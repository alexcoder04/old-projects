# old-projects

An archive space for discontinued projects from my early programming.
They are all here, because I didn't know about Git back then.

Some of the projects are finished and working, some not at all.

## What's here

| Project Name | Date | Language | Description |
|---|---|---|---|

| `Cloud` / `Magnan` | beginning 2021 | Python / Web | Cloud storage application with plugin support (similar to Nextcolud) |
| `Callix` | mid-end 2020 | Python | My first programming project ever while I learned Python, app for all around school |
