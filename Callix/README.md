# Callix

This is my first every programming project in the original state. It is just for nostalgia and educational reasons here, but if you are interested, you are welcome to study and improve the code. Maybe I'll look at it some time in the future again...

## Some background info

 - It is "an app for all around school": writing stuff down organized in folders, creating notes, saving homework tasks in the timetable...
 - I even started to write a GUI with PyQt5 and an HTML frontend later, but never finished it and never wrote a GUI again...
 - I didn't know about Git at that time yet, and I stopped the project at the time of refactoring, so I never understood, how to make it working again...
 - Some things still work, as I recovered some configuration files required for the project to run (`config` and `user` folders). It depends on custom xml formats I developed (but never documented) for different functions
 - Most, if not all, of the UI is in German, because I was in the process of learning English back then
